How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Showed the different lines only (much less text to look through)

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Find out isolated code serving a specific purpose.
    Instead of commenting code out delete them knowing that you can access them again

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: Creating logical checkpoints that makes sense to the developer
    Cons: Poor judgement can lead to too many or too few checkpoints

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Different purposes. Git is designed for source code version control

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Do a git log to get all commit IDs then compare the ones interested

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Since you can always revert to a previous commit no fear in changine anything
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Personal projects
