When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you want to collaborate with others or work with multiple machines for yourself or have the project history safe.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You don't want other people's changes coming in at random

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is cloning a repo on GitHub, clone copied repos local to local or remote to local. Branch is just a commit may exist anywhere

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can work on it offline and keep going with your development

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Less procedures for simple changes, however overall it would be very tedious and prone to mistakes using chats and comments and phone calls

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Checking in master is simple and faster
    Separating a branch is much more involved but allows for a review of the changes beforehand, especially if it's about an experimental feauture, etc.
